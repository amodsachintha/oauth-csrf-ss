##Introduction
This repo contains code on how to develop basic OAuth 2.0 flow using the Facebook's Graph API.
Furthermore, CSRF protection techniques such as Synchronizer Token Pattern and Double Submit Cookie are also implemented here as
part of the Secure Software Systems Module Assignment.

Laravel has been used as the php framework. Therefore, built-in CSRF protection features implemented in Laravel Middleware was disabled
for me to implement them manually.
